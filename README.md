# My Guide
## An Early WIP

This is the proof of concept for a service that would allow users to create a sort of "TV Guide" type schedule for themselves, consisting only of the programs they want to watch. The goal would be to help avoid choice paralysis by recreating the experience of a daily or weekly TV schedule but with the content available on streaming services.
